# Danny-Sales-SQL-project
I used SQL to answer important business questions posed in this case study. 

Introduction: Danny seriously loves Japanese food so at the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3favorite foods: sushi, curry and ramen. Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - The restaurant has captured some very basic data from its few months of operation but has no idea how to use its data to help it run the business.

Problem Statement: Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers and he plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
